The key analysis issues for each step that are listed below the lines are discussed in the text. a Preprocessing includes experimental design, sequencing design, and quality control steps. b Core analyses include transcriptome profiling, differential gene expression, and functional profiling. c Advanced analysis includes visualization, other RNA-seq technologies, and data integration. Abbreviations: ChIP-seq Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, eQTL Expression quantitative loci, FPKM Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads, GSEA Gene set enrichment analysis, PCA Principal component analysis, RPKM Reads per kilobase of exon model per million reads, sQTL Splicing quantitative trait loci, TF Transcription factor, TPM Transcripts per million.\nThree basic strategies for regular RNA-seq analysis. a An annotated genome is available and reads are mapped to the genome with a gapped mapper. Next (novel) transcript discovery and quantification can proceed with or without an annotation file. Novel transcripts are then functionally annotated. b If no novel transcript discovery is needed, reads can be mapped to the reference transcriptome using an ungapped aligner. Transcript identification and quantification can occur simultaneously. c When no genome is available, reads need to be assembled first into contigs or transcripts. For quantification, reads are mapped back to the novel reference transcriptome and further analysis proceeds as in (b) followed by the functional annotation of the novel transcripts as in (a). Representative software that can be used at each analysis step are indicated in bold text.

    "text": "1.2 Experimental design\nAre technical replicates needed for RNA-Seq analyses?\n\nWe find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once.\n\nMarioni et al. (2008)\nHow many biological replicates are needed in an RNA-seq experiment?\n\nSchurch et al. (2016)\nNumber of replicates can be calculated more precisely using power analysis. RnaSeqSampleSize is an R package for power analysis and sample size estimation for RNA-Seq experiment.\nZhao et al. (2018)\nRNASeqPower based spreadsheet (Google Sheet) and Shiny App.\nHart et al. (2013)\nMore sequencing depth or more biological replicates?\n\n\n\n(a) Increase in biological replication significantly increases the number of DE genes identified. Numbers of sequencing reads have a diminishing return after 10 M reads. Line thickness indicates depth of replication, with 2 replicates the darkest and 7 replicates the lightest. The lines are smoothed averages for each replication level, with the shaded regions corresponding to the 95% confidence intervals. (b) Power of detecting DE genes increases with both sequencing depth and biological replication. Similar to the trends in (a), increases in the power showed diminishing returns after 10 M reads. (c) ROC curves for three biological replicates. Sequencing deeper than 10 M reads did not significantly improve statistical power and precision for detecting DE genes. (d) The CV of logFC for the top 100 DE genes. The CV of the logFC estimates decreased significantly as we added more biological replicates, whereas adding sequencing depth after 10 M reads had much less effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a–c) The CV of logCPM for high expression level genes (a), medium expression level genes (b) and low expression level genes (c) (see Section 2 for definition). High/medium expression level genes have low CV for expression level estimates. Adding sequencing depth did not have significant effect on accuracy of estimation, whereas adding biological replicates improved accuracy significantly. For low expression level genes, both adding sequencing depth and adding biological replication level improved expression level estimation accuracy. (d) Number of DE genes plotted against the total estimated sequencing cost. If higher numbers of DE genes are needed, increased biological replication should be used.\n\n\nY. Liu et al. (2014)",

    "text": "1.3 RNA extraction\nImpact of RNA degradation on transcript quantification\n\nWe observed widespread effects of RNA quality on measurements of gene expression levels, as well as a slight but significant loss of library complexity in more degraded samples.\nWhile standard normalizations failed to account for the effects of degradation, we found that by explicitly controlling for the effects of RIN using a linear model framework we can correct for the majority of these effects. We conclude that in instances in which RIN and the effect of interest are not associated, this approach can help recover biologically meaningful signals in data from degraded RNA samples.\n\n\n\n\nA) PCA plot of the 15 samples included in the study based on data from 29,156 genes with at least one mapped read in a single individual. Different colors identify different time-points, while each shape indicates a particular individual in the data set. B) Spearman correlation plot of the 15 samples in the study. PCA, principal component analysis.\n\n\nGallego Romero et al. (2014)\n\nOur current analyses indicate that structured small RNAs with low GC content are recovered inefficiently when a small number of cells is used for RNA isolation with TRIzol. We further find that, in addition to miRNAs, some pre-miRNAs, small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are also extracted inefficiently under these conditions, reducing their representation in the pool of recovered RNAs.\n\nKim et al.

Antisense and pseudogenes were significantly enriched in differential expression analyses. Because stranded RNA-seq retains strand information of a read, we can resolve read ambiguity in overlapping genes transcribed from opposite strands, which provides a more accurate quantification of gene expression levels compared with traditional non-stranded RNA-seq.\nStranded RNA-seq provides a more accurate estimate of transcript expression compared with non-stranded RNA-seq, and is therefore the recommended RNA-seq approach for future mRNA-seq studies.\n\nZhao et al.

    "text": "1.9 Normalisation\n\n\n\nComparison of normalization methods for real data. (A) Boxplots of log2(counts + 1) for all conditions and replicates in the M. musculus data, by normalization method. (B) Boxplots of intra-group variance for one of the conditions (labeled ‘B’ in the corresponding data found in Supplementary Data) in the M. musculus data, by normalization method. (C) Analysis of housekeeping genes for the H. sapiens data. (D) Consensus dendrogram of differential analysis results, using the DESeq Bioconductor package, for all normalization methods across the four datasets under consideration.\n\n\nDillies et al. (2013)\n\n\n\nOne highly expressed gene. An experiment is performed with conditions A and B to compare expression for the three genes (1, 2 and 3). (A) Gene 3 is 2-fold up-regulated under condition B, while the other genes are not DE; the quantity of mRNA/cell (in bp) is the same for genes 1 and 2, but is twice as high for gene 3 under condition B. (B) Because of the change in expression of gene 3, the shares of mRNA in the cell are different between conditions. Under condition A, each gene gets one-third, whereas under condition B, gene 3 gets half while the other two get one-fourth. (C) Differences in shares of mRNA are reflected in the shares of reads. Each sample has the same total number of reads, but the distribution is different between the conditions, matching the distribution of mRNA in (B). (D) When no normalization is performed, there are apparent differences in read counts for all three genes. Total count normalization produces the exact same result as no normalization at all, as the total read count for each sample is the same. In truth, there is no difference in expression for genes 1 and 2, and the relative count for gene 3 should be higher than found by no normalization or total count normalization. Correct normalization, therefore, makes the read counts of the non-DE genes equivalent, which also makes the relative expression of gene 3 correct. (E) No normalization and total count normalization fail to equilibrate the read counts of the non-DE genes, resulting in each gene appearing DE, and the truly DE gene (gene 3) having the wrong fold change. Correct normalization reveals no difference in expression for the non-DE genes and the correct fold change for gene 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal shift in expression. There are two genes, and an experiment is performed to compare expression between condition A and condition B. (A) There is global up-regulation under condition B versus condition A, with both genes having twice the expression under condition B. Within each condition, the two genes produce the same amount of mRNA/cell (measured in bp). (B) In the RNA-Seq experiment, the same number of molecules are sequenced from each of the two samples. Proportionally, the mRNA composition is the same under each condition, and so the composition of molecules sequenced is also the same. Within each condition, the two genes produce the same amount of mRNA (in bp) but gene 2 is four-fifth the length of gene 1, so must produce five-fourth the number of molecules that gene 1 does. (C) Sequenced reads are aligned to the reference genome and mapped to each gene. The distribution of reads is the same in each sample, but by chance the sample for condition A happens to have more reads in total. (D) Normalization is performed, which removes the differences in read count from technical variability, so the read count for each gene is the same across conditions. (E) Because the normalized read counts are the same, the observed fold change for each gene is 1, indicating no differential expression. However, genes are really twice as expressed under condition B and so in truth we should see half the expression when comparing A with B.\n\n\nEvans et al. (2018)\n\n1.9.1 Use of RPKM & TPM\nIssues with RPKM and suggestion for use of TPM.\nWagner et al. (2012)\n\nBelow is a suggested workflow to follow in order to compare RPKM or TPM values across samples. 1. Make sure both samples are sequenced using the same protocol in terms of strandedness. If not, samples cannot be compared. 2. Make sure both samples use the same RNA isolation approach (polyA+ selection vs ribosomal RNA depletion). If not, they should not be compared. 3. Check the fraction of the ribosomal, mitochondrial and globin RNAs, and the top highly expressed transcripts and see whether such RNAs constitute a very large part of the sequenced reads in a sample, and thus decrease the sequencing ‘real estate’ available for the remaining genes in that sample. If the calculated fractions in two samples differ significantly, do not compare RPKM or TPM values directly. TPM should never be used for quantitative comparisons across samples when the total RNA contents and its distributions are very different. However, under appropriate circumstances, TPM can be still useful for qualitative comparison such as PCA and clustering analysis.\n\nZhao et al. (2020)",

Consider these covariates jointly instead of separately.\nBe as permissive of QC thresholding as possible, and revisit QC if downstream clustering cannot be interpreted.\nIf the distribution of QC covariates differ between samples, QC thresholds should be determined separately for each sample to account for sample quality differences\nWe recommend scran for normalization of non-full-length datasets. An alternative is to evaluate normalization approaches via scone especially for plate-based datasets. Full-length scRNA-seq protocols can be corrected for gene length using bulk methods.\nThere is no consensus on scaling genes to 0 mean and unit variance. We prefer not to scale gene expression.\nNormalized data should be log(x+1)-transformed for use with downstream analysis methods that assume data are normally distributed.\nRegress out biological covariates only for trajectory inference and if other biological processes of interest are not masked by the regressed out biological covariate.\nRegress out technical and biological covariates jointly rather than serially.\nPlate-based dataset pre-processing may require regressing out counts, normalization via non-linear normalization methods or downsampling.\nWe recommend performing batch correction via ComBat when cell type and state compositions between batches are consistent\nData integration and batch correction should be performed by different methods. Data integration tools may over-correct simple batch effects.\nUsers should be cautious of signals found only after expression recovery. Exploratory analysis may be best performed without this step.\nWe recommend selecting between 1,000 and 5,000 highly variable genes depending on dataset complexity.\nFeature selection methods that use gene expression means and variances cannot be used when gene expression values have been normalized to zero mean and unit variance, or when residuals from model fitting are used as normalized expression values. Thus, one must consider what pre-processing to perform before selecting HVGs.\nDimensionality reduction methods should be considered separately for summarization and visualization.\nWe recommend UMAP for exploratory visualization; PCA for general purpose summarization; and diffusion maps as an alternative to PCA for trajectory inference summarization.\nPAGA with UMAP is a suitable alternative to visualize particularly complex datasets.\nUse measured data for statistical testing, corrected data for visual comparison of data and reduced data for other downstream analysis based on finding the underlying biological data manifold.\nWe recommend clustering by Louvain community detection on a single-cell KNN graph.\nClustering does not have to be performed at a single resolution. Subclustering particular cell clusters is a valid approach to focus on more detailed substructures in a dataset.\nDo not use marker gene P-values to validate a cell-identity cluster, especially when the detected marker genes do not help to annotate the community. P-values may be inflated.\nNote that marker genes for the same cell-identity cluster may differ between datasets purely due to dataset cell type and state compositions.\nIf relevant reference atlases exist, we recommend using automated cluster annotation combined with data-derived marker-gene-based manual annotation to annotate clusters.\nConsider that statistical tests over changes in the proportion of a cell-identity cluster between samples are dependent on one another.\nInferred trajectories do not have to represent a biological process. Further sources of evidence should be collected to interpret a trajectory.\nDE testing should not be performed on corrected data (denoised, batch corrected, etc.), but instead on measured data with technical covariates included in the model.\nUsers should not rely on DE testing tools to correct models with confounded covariates. Model specification should be performed carefully ensuring a full-rank design matrix.\nWe recommend using MAST or limma for DE testing.\nUsers should be wary of uncertainty in the inferred regulatory relationships. Modules of genes that are enriched for regulatory relationships will be more reliable than individual edges.",

They all also perform better when the sparsity (zero counts) is less. For data with a high level of multimodality, methods that consider the behavior of each individual gene, such as DESeq2, EMDomics, Monocle2, DEsingle, and SigEMD, show better TPRs. If the level of multimodality is low, however, SCDE, MAST, and edgeR can provide higher precision.\n\n\nIn general, the methods that can capture multimodality (non-parametric methods), perform better than do the model-based methods designed for handling zero counts. However, a model-based method that can model the drop-out events well, can perform better in terms of true positive and false positive. We observed that methods developed specifically for scRNAseq data do not show significantly better performance compared to the methods designed for bulk RNAseq data; and methods that consider behavior of each individual gene (not all genes) in calling DE genes outperform the other tools.\n\n\n\n\nEffect of sample size (number of cells) on detecting DE genes.

We found that each batch-effect removal method has its advantages and limitations, with no clearly superior method. Based on our results, we found LIGER, Harmony, and Seurat 3 to be the top batch mixing methods. Harmony performed well on datasets with common cell types, and also different technologies. The comparatively low runtime of Harmony also makes it suitable for initial data exploration of large datasets. Likewise, LIGER performed well, especially on datasets with non-identical cell types. The main drawback of LIGER is its longer runtime than Harmony, though it is acceptable for its performance. Seurat 3 is also able to handle large datasets, however with 20–50% longer runtime than LIGER. Due to its good batch mixing results with multiple batches, it is also recommended for such scenarios. To improve recovery of DEGs in batch-corrected data, we recommend scMerge for batch correction.\n\nTran et al. (2020)\n\n Seurat (R)\n Harmony (R)\n Liger (R)\n FastMNN (R)\n Scanorama (Python)",

Adaptive mechanisms, more recently evolved, perform many of their functions by interacting with the older innate ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 4.2:  Innate and adaptive immunity time line. The mechanisms of innate immunity provide the initial defense against infections. Adaptive immune responses develop later and require the activation of lymphocytes. The kinetics of the innate and adaptive immune responses are approximations and may vary in different infections.\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\n4.1.2 Adaptive immunity\n\nHumoral immunity (B cells, antibodies)\nCell mediated immunity (CD4 Helper T cells, CD8 Cytotoxic T cells, Macrophages)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 4.3:  The figure shows an adaptive immune response to the first and second encounter with the SARS-CoV-2 antigen (spike protein).\n\n\n\nFollowing the first encounter, various antigens go through the process of phagocytosis and decomposition inside the antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs fragment the antigen into smaller peptides, which they present on their surface mediated by surface receptors called major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. The antigens are then presented to several types of cells in the host, among which we emphasize CD4+ T helper cells (also B and CD8+ cells). B cells which differentiate into plasma cells, secrete antibodies that inhibit the entry of the viral particle into the healthy cells. The activation of T helper cells by APC causes them to differentiate into different subtypes with specific functions mediated by cytokine secretion and cell-to-cell contact. Th2-differentiated T helper cells help humoral responses mature by providing a second signal to B cells, mostly through IL-4 secretion and CD40/CD40L interaction. Some CD4+ cells also become T follicular helper cells (Tfh), which govern the important interactions in the germinal centers important for the maturation of memory B cells and long-lived high-affinity antibody-producing plasma cells. Another subset of CD4+ T cells differentiates into a pool of memory T helper cells. Th1 T helper cells play a crucial role in cellular response formation. They pivot the MHC-I activation of CD8+ cells (CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes) by interacting with APC’s simultaneously. Activated CTLs then act by causing apoptosis (by Fasl ligand–FasL binding) of the host cells that are infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Some CTLs differentiate into memory cytotoxic T cells, which have the role of fast restoration of the CTL response with secondary antigen contacts. A similar mechanism of destruction occurs when NK cells interact with the virally infected cell. They contain granules with IFNγ and TNFα in their cytoplasm, which, when secreted, cause programmed cell death. As well, the mechanism of activation of NK cells does not occur through MHC molecules is important because MHC is not always present on the virally infected cells.\nPrimorac et al.

Image references: 1, 2, 3\n\n\n\nV(D)J recombination is the mechanism of somatic recombination that occurs only in developing lymphocytes during the early stages of T and B cell maturation. It results in the highly diverse repertoire of antibodies/immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (TCRs) found in B cells and T cells, respectively. The process is a defining feature of the adaptive immune system.\nV(D)J recombination in mammals occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells and thymus for T cells) and in a nearly random fashion rearranges variable (V), joining (J), and in some cases, diversity (D) gene segments. The process ultimately results in novel amino acid sequences in the antigen-binding regions of immunoglobulins and TCRs that allow for the recognition of antigens from nearly all pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and worms as well as “altered self cells” as seen in cancer.\nGermline organisation of the Ig locus\n\nIg proteins consists of two identical heavy and light chains\n\nH chain locus is located on Chr 14\n\nThe light chains can be kappa or lamba\n\nKappa chain locus on Chr 2\nLamba chain locus on Chr 22\n\n\n\n4.3.0.1 BCR review\n\nBCR consist of two heavy and 2 light chains. Heavy chain has 1 V domains and 4-5 C domains. Light chain contains 1 C and 1 V domain.\nCDR in V domains makes contact with antigen\nFollowing antigen stimulation, B cells secrete immunoglobulins that bear the same antigen binding site as the BCR\n\n\n\n4.3.0.2 TCR review\n\nHuman T cells develop in the thymus and they acquire the ability to recognize foreign antigens and provide protection against many different pathogens.\nThis functional flexibility is guaranteed by the expression of highly polymorphic surface receptors called T cell receptors (TCRs).\nTCR is composed of two different protein chains. The vast majority of human T cells express TCRs composed of α (alpha) and β (beta) chains.\nThe genes encoding alpha (TCRA) and beta (TCRB) chains are composed of multiple non-contiguous gene segments which include variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments for TCRB gene and variable (V) and joining (J) for TCRA gene.\nThe enormous diversity of T cell repertoires is generated by random combinations of germ line gene segments (combinatorial diversity) and by random addition or deletion at the junction site of the segments that have been joined (junctional diversity).\nThe sequence encoded by the V(D)J junction is called complementarity determining region 3 or CDR3. This sequence has the highest variability in both alpha and beta chains and determines the ability of a T cell to recognize an antigen.\nThe total number of possible combination is estimated to exceed 10^18.\nThe diversity of naïve T cells is the T cell repertoire\nExposure to an antigen drives a rapid clonal expansion of cells carrying identical TCRs to generate a population of “effector cells.”\nAfter antigen clearance, a reduced number of these cells remain in the blood as “memory cells.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 4.8:  Somatic V(D)J arrangement in the alpha and beta chains. (A) Genomic organization and somatic recombination of TCRB and TCRA loci. Antigen repertoire diversity is guaranteed by a recombination step that progressively rearranges V, D, and J segments for T cell receptor (TCR) beta chains and V and J segments for TCR alpha chains. This variability (combinatorial diversity) is further increased by addition or deletion of nucleotides at the junction sites (junctional diversity). (B) Productive arrangements of beta and alpha transcripts. (C) Organization of TCR. TCR is composed by two subunits TCR alpha and TCR beta each organized in a constant region and a variable region responsible for antigen recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 4.9:  Differences between BCR and TCR receptors.",

    "text": "5.1 Overview\nATAC-seq provides a simple and scalable way to assay the regions of the genome that are bound by TFs, and to compare how these landscapes change between particular contexts or perturbations. This is accomplished using in vitro transposition of sequencing adapters into native chromatin. Each unique transposition event, termed an ‘insertion’, marks a location in the genome where a Tn5 transposase dimer is able to access DNA and perform a cut-and-paste reaction. The transposase simultaneously fragments the DNA and inserts sequence handles that are then used for amplification during library preparation.\nGrandi et al. (2022), Yan et al. (2020)\nOur benchmarking results highlight SnapATAC, cisTopic, and Cusanovich2018 as the top performing scATAC-seq data analysis methods to perform clustering across all datasets and different metrics. Methods that preserve information at the peak level (cisTopic, Cusanovich2018, Scasat) or bin level (SnapATAC) generally outperform those that summarize accessible chromatin regions at the motif/k-mer level (chromVAR, BROCKMAN, SCRAT) or over the gene body (Cicero, Gene Scoring). In addition, methods that implement a dimensionality reduction step (BROCKMAN, cisTopic, Cusanovich2018, Scasat, SnapATAC) generally show advantages over the other methods without this important step. SnapATAC is the most scalable method; it was the only method capable of processing more than 80,000 cells. Cusanovich2018 is the method that best balances analysis performance and running time.\nChen et al. (2019)\nscATAC-Seq analysis in R\nSignac\nStuart et al. (2021)",
